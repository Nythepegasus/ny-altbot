# Commands
* ~~Permissions~~
  * ~~Any permissions: `needs<Role>` permission based system in the command file~~
  * ~~Assume permissons allowed are Role< (ex. Admin/Owner/higher can run `needsMod` commands)~~
* Timeout
  * ~~Command timeouts to reduce/prevent spam, reply with an ephemeral message warning the user on spam~~
    * ~~`Discord.Collection` or something similar to keep track of timeouts, or if necessary,~~
    * MongoDB storage for longer term commands, daily/weekly commands
* Porting
  * Getting the rest of the old commands ported over
  * This will have to wait until after permissions and timeouts.

# Tweaks DB
* Something similar to r/jailbreak's bot to find jailbreak tweaks.
  * Pricing will be an issue (possibly need to scrape), but I can get general information from repos.

# Moderation Tools
* More moderation tools for anti-scam spam
